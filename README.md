# Lightroom-Catalog-Cleaner

Get the last release [here](https://github.com/MaximeChaillou/Lightroom-Catalog-Cleaner/releases/download/0.2/Lightroom.Catalog.Cleaner.0.2.zip).

Lightroom Catalog Cleaner allows you to remove all the non-picked RAW/DNG file (white flag) on your Lightroom catalog to free space on your drive.
Just open the catalog you want to clean then it will clean it up in one click.

If you shoot in RAW + Jpeg, it will keep all the Jpeg files.

Works with Lightroom 5 and 6.
